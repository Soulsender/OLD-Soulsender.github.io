## Hello! My name is Soulsender. 
I am a Canadian high-school student studying computer science and cybersecurity. I enjoy using Linux, most commonly Debian-based operating systems such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or just plain Debian. I use these systems for my daily desktop use, and also use them in cloud-based servers of my own. My favorite desktop enviroment is KDE Plasma ;)

My most commonly used programming language is Python, however I know some rudimentary Bash scripting, and I am learning Golang.
