                        Technology is a sacred form of information. Things you may never mention to another human being, you state and search without fear. Perhaps it is something seemingly mundane, such as an embarrassing medical condition. Other times, it might be something more sinister, devious, or pornographic. Whatever the case, everyone has something to hide - even if they say they don’t. Spying and surveillance; this is what “Little Brother” and “Homeland” by Cory Doctorow explores.
                        <br><br>
                        In the book “Little Brother” we follow Marcus, an intelligent and elusive teenage hacker from San Francisco. After a terrorist attack renders the Bay Bridge destroyed, he finds that the Department of Homeland Secuirty has stepped in, and increased the surveillance of the city by tenfold - effectively turning it into a police state. Metal detectors, face and gait trackers, and police patdowns populate every corner of the city. Even in his own house, he felt “all alone and under surveillance at the same time.” (Doctorow). Reading this book truly helps you understand how many vectors of attack surveillance can become. Not only with cameras, but digitally as well - with data packet sniffers, malware, and firewalls, with one of the only solutions being physical - such as the case where one of the characters “opened her door, holding her laptop in one hand and its battery in the other.” (Doctorow). In this scenario, paranoia is king. Extreme does not seem so extreme, like how “it was [insanely hard] to poison a computer's BIOS remotely, but if [he] was going to [rebuild the computer], ignoring the BIOS would be like changing all your house locks after losing your keys but leaving all the windows unlocked.” (Doctorow). Throughout both “Little Brother” and “Homeland”, Marcus employs tactics like encryption, obfuscation, and the Dark Web to counteract the state’s propaganda. These are not made-up technologies, some have even been around for decades.
                        <br><br>
                        For a modern example, currently in Iran there is a power struggle between the facist dictators and the citizens vying for change. The struggle in Iran is disturbingly similar to what we see in “Little Brother”. The government has instituted a firewall for the whole nation that blocks access to many of the outside world services - such as google and amazon. This can be bypassed by the citizens using technology like TOR (The Onion Router) in conjunction with other techniques like Snowflake proxies to hide the traffic. Another example could be the overturn of Roe v Wade in the United States. Where once it was legal to have abortions done, now it is a crime of “Fetal Homicide” in multiple states, with the punishment varying, one case resulting in 20 years in prison. If found, women attempting to get an abortion in a state where it is illegal, may even be punished for searching online as a <a href="https://prospect.org/health/punishing-women-abortion/">“premeditated act”</a> - such as a murderer might do to hide a body before killing someone. Perhaps one day, they might very well be able to institute laws to install a “Root Certificate'' on citizen’s devices, a technology to view encrypted browser traffic under the guise of “terrorist protection”. Sort of like a security check at an airport, nothing evil can get to you if everything is stopped and checked, however this comes at the cost of your privacy. These things are happening all around us, only slowly. It’s easier to get people to adapt to new scenarios, easing them, instead of throwing them right into it. Like cooking a lobster, changing the temperature very slowly so it does not notice. Not only governments, but corporations in tandem with governments. Any corporation will give your data away to law enforcement for any reason if they ask. Why wouldn’t they? They only care about their income - not you, the consumer. It is a tired statement, but you truly are just a number and metric to them. Last login, location of login, browser used, what you were doing exactly, etc. So in reality - how different are corporations from the government in surveillance?

                        We must be mindful of what it means to be free, one of the characters in “Little Brother” directly referencing this, saying: “I can't go underground for a year, ten years, my whole life, waiting for freedom to be handed to me. Freedom is something you have to take for yourself.” (Doctorow 280). Everyone deserves the right to privacy.
