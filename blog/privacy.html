                        <h3>I believe in privacy</h3> 
                        
                        It’s a sacred thing, your mind is the only place where nobody can truly see. The problem with digital information is that it’s very hard for you to view it as something physical which in turn makes it hard to view it as something important.
                        <br><br>
                        Whenever I talk about this, there's always one person asking about why they should care if “they don’t have anything to hide.” To that one person - let me ask you this: do you leave your windows open while on the toilet? Do you leave your blinds up when you sleep? Do you set a lock on your phone or computer? All of these are instances of you attempting to protect some kind of information, and if you don't believe me, think about whether or not you would unlock your phone and give it to the nearest person to you to look through.
                        <br><br>
                        Here’s an example. In June of 2022, the overturn of Roe v Wade in the United States occurred. Where once it was legal to have abortions done, the process is now a crime of “Fetal Homicide” in multiple states, with the punishment varying, one case resulting in 20 years in prison. If found, women attempting to get an abortion in a state where it is illegal, may even be arrested and punished for <b>searching</b> for a clinic with Google as a “premeditated act" to be used against them in court. 
                        
                        
                        <h3>What About Criminals?</h3>
                        Alright, well even if you trust a certain company, and you don’t mind a megacorporation like Meta or Google to have information about your thoughts and opinions, what about criminals? When information about a user is taken on a website such as TikTok, it is usually stored in a database, just like passwords for those users. Data breaches are instances of these databases being revealed, and this information is often made public or available for a price. Don’t worry though, passwords are usually stored in an encrypted way in these databases, almost like a secret code, so even if they are leaked they can be hard to crack and actually use. Unfortunately, user information is not encrypted, and can be available to view in standard text. This means your address, postal code, name, username, email, and many other things are just clear to see. 
                        <br><br>
                        This is exactly what happened at the largest psychotherapy clinic in Finland called Vastaamo in 2022. A hacker got past the security systems of the company, and downloaded the entire patient database to use as a ransom. When he did not get the money he asked for, the hacker published the entire database online. This breach contained not only addresses and emails, but notes from the therapists of clients about the clients. Private stories of abuse, suicide, and items that could (and did) cost people their jobs and futures.
                        <br><br>
                        These are your personal thoughts and feelings - and neglect of proper security and privacy measures lead these to be exposed to the world. Even still, these notes are something that the clients of the psychotherapy clinic <b>voluntarily</b> gave to be noted in what they thought was a secure fashion. Imagine what a company such as Google could do with your search data or emails without you even giving consent for that information to be viewed by anybody other than yourself.

                        <h3>Technology is Sacred</h3>
                        The truth is that technology is a sacred form of information. Things you may never mention to another human being, you state and search without fear. Perhaps it is something seemingly mundane, such as an embarrassing medical condition. Other times, it might be something more sinister, devious, or pornographic. Whatever the case, everyone has something to hide - even if they say they don’t. Spying and surveillance; this is what “Little Brother” and “Homeland” by Cory Doctorow explores.
                        <br><br>
                        In the book “Little Brother” we follow Marcus, an intelligent and elusive teenage hacker from San Francisco. After a terrorist attack renders the Bay Bridge destroyed, he finds that the Department of Homeland Secuirty has stepped in, and increased the surveillance of the city by tenfold - effectively turning it into a police state. Metal detectors, face and gait trackers, and police patdowns populate every corner of the city. Even in his own house, he felt “all alone and under surveillance at the same time.” (Doctorow). Reading this book truly helps you understand how many vectors of attack surveillance can become. Not only with cameras, but digitally as well - with data packet sniffers, malware, and firewalls, with one of the only solutions being physical - such as the case where one of the characters “opened her door, holding her laptop in one hand and its battery in the other.” (Doctorow). In this scenario, paranoia is king. Extreme does not seem so extreme, like how “it was [insanely hard] to poison a computer's BIOS remotely, but if [he] was going to [rebuild the computer], ignoring the BIOS would be like changing all your house locks after losing your keys but leaving all the windows unlocked.” (Doctorow). Throughout both “Little Brother” and “Homeland”, Marcus employs tactics like encryption, obfuscation, and the Dark Web to counteract the state’s propaganda. These are not made-up technologies, some have even been around for decades.
                        
                        <h3>A Modern Example</h3>
                        For a modern example, currently in Iran there is a power struggle between the facist dictators and the citizens vying for change. The struggle in Iran is disturbingly similar to what we see in “Little Brother”. The government has instituted a firewall for the whole nation that blocks access to many of the outside world services - such as google and amazon. This can be bypassed by the citizens using technology like TOR (The Onion Router) in conjunction with other techniques like Snowflake proxies to hide the traffic. Perhaps one day, they might very well be able to institute laws to install a “Root Certificate'' on citizen’s devices, a technology to view encrypted browser traffic under the guise of “terrorist protection”. Sort of like a security check at an airport, nothing evil can get to you if everything is stopped and checked, however this comes at the cost of your privacy. These things are happening all around us, only slowly. It’s easier to get people to adapt to new scenarios, easing them, instead of throwing them right into it. Like cooking a lobster, changing the temperature very slowly so it does not notice. 
                        <br><br>
                        What about further down the line? Even if today's government is stable and prosperous, who's to say that the future government will be the same? They will have all the same powers of surveillance, but it will be used against you - not for you. 

                        
                        <h3>Not Only Governments</h3>
                        Not only governments, but corporations in tandem with governments. Any corporation will give your data away to law enforcement for any reason if they ask. Why wouldn’t they? They only care about their income - not you, the consumer. It is a tired statement, but you truly are just a number and metric to them. Last login, location of login, browser used, what you were doing exactly, etc. So in reality - how different are corporations from the government in surveillance?
                        <br><br>
                        We must be mindful of what it means to be free, one of the characters in “Little Brother” directly referencing this, saying: “I can't go underground for a year, ten years, my whole life, waiting for freedom to be handed to me. Freedom is something you have to take for yourself.” (Doctorow 280). Everyone deserves the right to privacy.
