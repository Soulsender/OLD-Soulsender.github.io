                        <h3 id="signal">Signal the Secure Messager App</h3>
    
                        <p>
                            Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram Messager, iMessage, etc., Signal is a open-source messaging app. This means that the code is available <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">for anyone to look at.</a> This means that it is more secure, and more private than other closed-source apps like the ones listed above. It cannot have secret hidden backdoors for the government to be listening in, because it is quite literally not written into the code of the app. 
                            <br><br>
                            Signal also uses End-2-End (E2E) encryption. Unlike other messager apps that use traditional encryption like Facebook and Apple, the messages you send only YOU and the recipient can see. This works because you are generated a special key (public and private versions) that you exchange with the recipient. This is actually quite an old process, and you can do it manually using something like <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GPG</a>, although this manual process won't be practical for daily use.

                            <br><br>

                            As is proven in <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/">this article,</a> Signal does not take any more infomation than is required, and will not give it to the United States government. Additionly, they work with the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union)</a>.

                            <br><br>

                            Signal comes with some quirks and features for anonymity, you can set it to <a href="https://twitter.com/tarah/status/1540376115201462272">automatically delete</a> messages after a certain timeframe. You can also set it to require a PIN by going Settings > Privacy > Screen Lock. 

                            <br><br>

                            (And for all the nerds out there, yes, I know Matrix exists, but no normal end user is going to be able to set up their own self-hosted Matrix server)

                                <h5>TL;DR</h5>

                                Signal is open-source and is not used to spy on users. It truly does not collect infomation aside from last login connection, and date of account creation. It's traffic is secured via E2E encryption.

                        <p>
                            VPNs are one of the most generally misinformed pieces of technology security ever made. Many advertisers such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, PrivateInternetAccess, etc., straight out lie to their customers, so I will go into the myths and truths of VPNs here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY">Tom Scott</a> made a very good video about this as well.

                            <img src="../images/staying-hidden/vpn-diagram.png">

                            <h5>Myths</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>All your traffic is unencrypted and freely available for attackers -</b> Most modern internet connections use HTTPS and not the outdated HTTP protocol. See <a class="smoothscroll" href="#domains">domain names</a> for more infomation about the difference.</li>
                                <li><b>They will not give out data -</b> Most VPN companies will <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/how-nordvpn-protects-the-privacy-of-its-customers/">absolutely</a> give your data to law enforcement if asked. I will go into more details about this later on.</li>
                                <li><b>They do not keep logs -</b> Almost all VPN companies keep logs of their users activity for legal reason. The basic premise is instead of giving your internet traffic to your Internet Service Provider, you give it to this VPN company.</li>
                                <li><b>They use "military grade" encryption -</b> There is no "military grade" encryption, VPN connections use the same kind of encryption that anything else does (which is basically impossible to crack with modern computers). This encryption is no harder to break than standard <a class="smoothscroll" href="#domains">HTTPS</a> encryption.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Truths</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>It changes your location -</b> Yes, this is the true point of VPNs. Their true and original purpose was not for specifically security, but to gain access to a network from outside the network. If you had a server on a network and you were outside the network and wanted to access it, you would connect to a VPN server inside the netowrk and you would have access to all those device on that network. </li>
                                <li><b>It gives you the server's IP address -</b> Any website that you visit will see the VPN server's <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/">IP address</a> and not your own. </li>
                                <li><b>The network you are on can see you are using a VPN -</b> Any network you are on will be able to see that you are making a VPN connection. They cannot see what the <i>contents</i> of the traffic are, but they do know that you are not using standard HTTPS/HTTP.</li>
                                <li><b>It encrypts your traffic -</b> VPNs will actually encrypt your traffic, although most times it isn't super useful. The most common use case for this is if you are visiting a HTTP site that does not support HTTPS.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>My Personal Trusted Providers</h5>
                            (this is not sponsored, these are genuinely good)
                            <ul>
                                <li><b><a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">(PAID) Mullvad VPN -</a></b> I would not use VPNs for full anonymity. See <a class="smoothscroll" href="#tor">The Darkweb and Tor</a> for more infomation on why. That being said, Mullvad is open-source, uses a open-source VPN protocol of which you can choose between, is able to be paid for in <a href="https://www.monero.how/how-does-monero-privacy-work">Monero</a> which is the most private cryptocurrency (fuck bitcoin), and also hard cash via mailing. It is also based primarily in Sweden, and not American giving it Swedish privacy law jurisdiction. It is also CHEAPER than NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc.</li>
                                <li><b><a href="https://protonvpn.com/">(FREE) ProtonVPN -</a></b> I generally do not trust free VPN services, I don't even trust most paid VPN services. That being said, if you are not able to pay for Mullvad, or you don't want any sort of transaction to be made, then ProtonVPN would be my suggestion. It's open-source, and Swiss-based, giving it access to Swiss privacy laws.</li>

                                VPNs are very misinformed. They will change your virtual location. They will use the VPN server's IP address. VPN providers will keep logs, and they will give those logs to law enforcement. <b>They are not meant for security.

                        <p>
                            <h5>Tor - The Onion Browser</h5>
                            This is where your anonymity starts to get serious. The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor browser</a> is a special browser specifically designed to be completely anonymous (it's actually a forked version of Firefox if you can believe it). <b>THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT DOWNLOADING THE TOR BROWSER.</b> It's actually funded by the United States government (I'll explain this later and why it's ok). 

                            <br><br>

                            The Tor Browser uses a special type of technology called Onion Routing. This is named after an onion, because this type of routing uses "layers" to mask the user's traffic.

                            <img style="margin-left: 80px;" src="../images/staying-hidden/tor-diagram.jpeg"><br>

                            This traffic is encrypted in a multi-layer way, where the relays cannot see past the next connected relay. The only thing the first relay will see is where the data is coming from, and the location of the next relay. The relay after that one will only see the relay before, and the relay after, but not the source of the data. This continues, until the last relay can see the destination of the traffic, but not the origin. Typically there will be 3 relays by default, but you could increase this at the cost of the speed of the connection. 

                            <br><br>

                            <h5>Tor with a VPN (don't do it)</h5>

                            Some people say you should use tor with a VPN for "maximum" privacy, but this is not true, and might compromise your security. 

                            <br><br>

                            On <a>this page</a> on the tor wiki, they explain why you should not do this.

                            <blockquote>
                                "You can very well decrease your anonymity by using VPN/SSH in addition to Tor. (Proxies are covered in an extra chapter below.) If you know what you are doing you can increase anonymity, security and privacy.
                                <br><br>
                                Most VPN/SSH provider log, there is a money trail, if you can't pay really anonymously. (An adversary is always going to probe the weakest link first...). A VPN/SSH acts either as a permanent entry or as a permanent exit node. This can introduce new risks while solving others.
                                <br><br>
                                Who's your adversary? Against a global adversary with unlimited resources more hops make passive attacks (slightly) harder but active attacks easier as you are providing more attack surface and send out more data that can be used. Against colluding Tor nodes you are safer, against blackhat hackers who target Tor client code you are safer (especially if Tor and VPN run on two different systems). If the VPN/SSH server is adversary controlled you weaken the protection provided by Tor. If the server is trustworthy you can increase the anonymity and/or privacy (depending on set up) provided by Tor.
                                <br><br>
                                VPN/SSH can also be used to circumvent Tor censorship (on your end by the ISP or on the service end by blocking known tor exits)."
                                <br><br>
